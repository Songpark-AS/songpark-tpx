= Linux

The teleporter has one FPGA part, and one ARM part. The ARM port is run by a small Linux distribution.


== 3rd party software required for the Teleporter

* socat
* java v11

== services

Bridge, virtual ports and TPX are all run as services on the Teleporter. They are installed under `/etc/system/systemd/` and are located in the git repo under `deployment/`.

The services are dependant on each other, with `virtual ports -> bridge -> TPX` as the dependancy chain.

== File structure

All files, minux tpx.jar (which is always generated), should be available in the `deployment/` folder in the git repo.
