= Tests


== Unit tests

No automated unit tests are implemented at the moment. Due to the hard dependancy on other pieces of the entire solution stack, any automated unit tests would come with a high cost to implement as well as maintain, while giving little benefit as TPX is mainly an integration piece of software, meaning integration tests are much more important.


== Integration tests

Integration tests are handled by the test suite.
