= Numato Card FPGA Connection

== Numato Card interfacing
=== 1.1 The Numato Card
The Numato Ethernet card is based on the LAN8211E physical layer (PHY)
transceiver chip. The Numato card exposes an RGMII interface to interface with
the FPGA on the Zedboard. The RGMII reduces the number of pins needed to
interface with the card compared to GMII versions of PHY cards

Figure 1.1 shows the Numato card hardware module. It was selected since
it allowed the addition of an FPGA controlled ethernet interface at the most
competitive price in the market. However, the Numato card was not designed for
the Zedboard, so some soldering and pin adjustments need to be done to connect
the card successfully to the Zedboard.

=== 1.2 Numato Card Interfaces
The Numato card is designed to work at 3.3 V. The FPGA pins must also be
configured to work at 3.3 V. The card has three 2x6 pin expansion headers
(connectors) for interfacing with FPGAs, microprocessors or MACs.

Figure 1.2 shows the interfaces block diagram of the Numato card. The card
support I2C and MDIO interfaces for PHY control. We use the MDIO interface.

=== 1.3 FPGA Ethernet Card Connection
Tables 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 show the Interface pins provided by the Numato card and
also how they are connected to the FPGA. The tables are colour coded for easier reading

==== 1.3.1 Numato Card Control
The Numato pins are connected to the Switch block in the FPGA. The switch
block handles both data communication with the Numato card. This allows the
ARM core and the streaming core to share the same physical interface. Traffic
destined for the Linux kernel enters the ARM core via the Eth1 interface. While
traffic destined for the streaming core goes to the streaming network stack, which
is in the FPGA. The PHY is controlled by the Linux kernel via the MDIO interface.
